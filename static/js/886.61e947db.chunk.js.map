My name is Adedotun Ajibade, and I am a self-taught\n          software engineer. I have a passion for exploring new technologies and\n          have explored technologies ranging from web development to machine\n          learning. I am an enthustistic learner and is always looking for new\n          opportunities to learn and grow.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I received my Bachelors of Technology degree in Industrial Mathematics\n          from the Federal University of Technology, Akure in Nigeria,\n          graduating with a first class. During my undergraduate studies, I\n          gained a solid foundation in Mathematics and statistics and was\n          introduced to the Python programming language. Armed with these and my\n          interest in computer science, I delved into Data Science and Machine\n          learning - a journey which started with a bootcamp in 2018 at Curators\n          University(Coven labs) in Ondo State, Nigeria. I have since worked on\n          a number of projects most especially with postgraduate students on\n          their thesis. I am currently working as an IT support at Digital Pulse\n          Technologies in Lagos, Nigeria where I am udergoing the compulsory\n          National Youth Service.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In my current role at Digital Pulse Technologies, I work with other\n          developers to develop and maintain USSD applications, SMS applications\n          and other neccesary features. I am skilled in varieties of programming\n          languages including Python, Javascript, and Dart, and have experience\n          with technologies and frameworks including data science and machine\n          learning, Flutter, React.js, and cloud services.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In my free time, I enjoy playing around with new technologies, playing\n          video games, and watching anime. I am open to new opportunities as\n          well as contibuting to open source software. Feel free to reach out to\n          me on any of my social media platforms.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default About;\n"],"names":["id","Helmet"],"sourceRoot":""}
